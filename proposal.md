# Introduction
This section introduces your problem and the overall plan for approaching the problem you plan to address in your project.

# Problem Statement
Describe your problem, specifying the dataset you plan to use, expected results, and evaluation. Please list any specific dataset or benchmark you plan to use. For example, if you are collecting new data, how will you do it?

# Technical Approach
What method or algorithm are you proposing? If there are existing implementations, will you use them, and how? How do you plan to improve or modify such implementations? You may not have an exact answer at this point, but you should have a general sense of how you will approach the problem you are working on.

# Evaluation
How will you evaluate your results? (i) Qualitatively: what kind of results do you expect (e.g., plots or figures)? (ii) Quantitatively: what analysis will you use to evaluate and/or compare your results (e.g., performance metrics or statistical tests)?

# Related Work
Discuss published work related to your project. How is your approach similar or different from others? You may not be aware of all related work at this point, but it is essential to search whether there has been any prior work related to the idea you envision for your project. I highly recommend updating this section throughout your project as soon as you find any related work.

# References
What reading will you examine to provide context and background? Please make sure to cite all relevant publications, blog posts, and any resources that are related to your project.
